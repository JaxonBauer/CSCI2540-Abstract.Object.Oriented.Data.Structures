***CIRCLE PROJECT***

_This was an individual project_

This project introduced overloading, as well as using multiple classes within a Java program.

***Point Class***

* A class used to create a new point in (x,y) format.
* Uses multiple constructors to make points.
* Includes methods such as toString, getDistance, equals, and getNumberOfPoints to perform different operations and save the results.

***ExtendedCircle Class***

* A class used to create a new circle
* Uses multiple constructors to make circles, based on how much information is provided.
* Includes methods such as compArea, compCircumference, toString, positionToCircle, shift, scale, overlap, and equals to perform various different operations to a circle.

***ExtendedCircleTest Class***

A list of all of the tests that I ran through for each class.
