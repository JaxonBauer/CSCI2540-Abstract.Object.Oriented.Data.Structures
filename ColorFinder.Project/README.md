***COLOR FINDER PROJECT***

_This was an individual project._

* Takes input from the user in string form.
* Checks the string to see if an additive primary color is found.
* Checks the string to see if a subjective primary color is found.
* If one or the other is found, a message will be printed to the screen to tell the user the results.
