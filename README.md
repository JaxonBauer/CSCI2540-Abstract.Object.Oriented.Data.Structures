# CSCI 2540 - Abstract Object Oriented Data Structures Projects

* A repository of all java projects I have worked on throughout this course (CSCI2540 - Abstract Object Oriented Data Structures).

* Includes all school projects that I worked on throughout the semester.

* All projects are purely my own code, as I did not pull this code from anyone or anywhere.

This class taught me how to use the fundamentals of the java language. Throughout this course, we covered abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables, graphs, and sets. We also used object-oriented programming (such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract class, interface, Java generics, etc) to implement these various types of abstract data.

At the end of the course, I feel confident in my abilities to:

*Understand the different fundamental methods of data organization.
*Choose the most appropriate data structures for a given computational problem.
*Use programming principles to develop effective algorithms.
*Implement multimodular programs which use class libraries for data structures.
